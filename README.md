# daily-geography
Hello, this recent project of mine, which I am calling Daily Geography is a quiz game which has a daily geography quiz consisting of 5 questions. It is partially inspired by Wordle in how it is a daily challenge mini-game sort of website.
The current build is a fully functional quiz that never ends. The goal is to use cookies to keep track of if you've done the quiz or not, and to keep track of score.
